  <h2>More About Me</h2>

   <article>
  <p>
    I came from a very humble beginning, I love to go to school but on many occasions I cant afford to go to school,
    not because I’m lazy but because I don’t have a pair of shoes to get in the class, no food for lunch, no money to ride for a tricycle, not
    enough books to read, no internets nor television.
    Yet the only weapon I have is God, I believe in Him that He will provide all means to be called one of the “successful”.
    I strive hard, no rides? I walk 4 miles back and forth from my school to house,
    no food? No worries, I bargain my homework with my classmates and in return getting free lunch from them, and I’m telling you,
    I even manage to sell fruits and vegetables inside my school. I gain profit, I develop my skills, some say its embarrassing
    but for me its my only way to overcome poverty. I’m not ashamed, I am proud of it.
    Those struggles helped me to become stronger and to have more faith in God.
    I finished my college degree, two major within 4 yrs of studying in my country, how did I do
    it? I worked as a working student, librarian during the day and student guard during at night.
    It was tough first year of my college life. Yet I endure, because I believed! During my college life,
     I manage to get scholarship and sponsorship to finished
    my studies. God provided me good people to be of great help especially financially.
    And of course I finished Bachelor of Theology, and some major on Secondary Education.
     I love to learn and I will always keep improving myself. Now, I’m so blessed
    that I get into Galvanize as a Web Developer. Everything is new with me hence I've never  done any programming before,
     but I’m so glad that I’m here, constantly growing my skills, expanding what I have and to be a better person. Networking and socializing
    with bright minds learning from them and get inspirations.
    I'm looking forward to be successful web developer, working with companies help them grow,
    and develop creative apps that can be benefited by everyone. "Never stop learning, Learning never exhausts the mind ".
